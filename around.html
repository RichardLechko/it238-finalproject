      <h2>By Train</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            France boasts one of the most advanced rail systems in the world.
            The TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse) high-speed trains connect major
            cities like Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Bordeaux, making it easy to
            travel long distances quickly. Regional trains (TER) and Intercités
            services cover smaller towns and rural areas. Booking tickets in
            advance can save you money, and rail passes are available for
            tourists planning extensive travel by train.

      <h2>By Car</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            Renting a car is a fantastic option for those who want to explore
            the French countryside at their own pace. Major rental agencies are
            available in cities, airports, and train stations. Driving in France
            is generally straightforward, but be aware of toll roads
            (autoroutes) and ensure you have a GPS or map handy. Parking in
            cities can be challenging, so consider using public transportation
            for urban exploration and saving the car for more rural adventures.

      <h2>By Bus</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            Buses offer an affordable way to travel between cities and within
            regions. Companies like FlixBus and Ouibus provide long-distance
            services, while local bus networks operate within cities and towns.
            Despite being slower than trains, buses are often cheaper, making
            them a good option for budget-conscious travelers. Additionally,
            buses offer the flexibility of reaching destinations that may not
            have direct train connections, allowing travelers to explore more
            remote areas.

      <h2>By Bicycle</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            Cycling is a popular and eco-friendly way to see France, especially
            in regions like the Loire Valley, Provence, and Brittany. Many
            cities offer bike-sharing programs, such as Vélib' in Paris,
            allowing you to rent and return bikes at various locations.
            Dedicated cycling paths and routes, like the famous EuroVelo routes,
            make it easy to explore scenic areas on two wheels. Furthermore,
            cycling provides a unique and immersive experience, allowing
            travelers to connect with the landscape and culture of France at
            their own pace.
