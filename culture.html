      <h2>Greetings and Etiquette</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            When visiting France, it's important to be aware of local customs
            and etiquette. Greetings are significant, so start interactions with
            a friendly "Bonjour" (good day) or "Bonsoir" (good evening). A firm
            handshake is appropriate for initial meetings, while friends and
            family often exchange a kiss on both cheeks, known as "la bise."
            Politeness is key, so always use "s'il vous plaît" (please) and
            "merci" (thank you), and address people with "Monsieur" (Mr.),
            "Madame" (Mrs.), or "Mademoiselle" (Miss) until invited to use their
            first name.

      <h2>Dining Etiquette</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            Dining in France is a leisurely affair. Lunch is typically served
            between 12:00 and 2:00 PM, and dinner starts around 7:00 PM. Eating
            on the go is considered impolite, so plan to sit and enjoy your
            meals. In restaurants, greet the staff with "Bonjour" upon entering
            and wait to be seated. Meals are unhurried, and tipping, while
            appreciated, is not obligatory; rounding up the bill or leaving a
            few euros is common. Keep both hands (but not elbows) on the table
            during meals, and place your knife and fork parallel on the plate
            when finished eating.

      <h2>Social Customs</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            Social customs in France emphasize meaningful conversations, avoiding contentious topics unless familiar
            with
            companions. When visiting someone's home, bringing flowers, chocolates, or wine is customary. Punctuality is
            valued, especially for formal events or business meetings. Greet people with "Bonjour" or "Bonsoir" and use
            polite phrases like "s'il vous plaît" and "merci" to show respect.

      <h2>Dress Code</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            The French take pride in their appearance and tend to dress
            elegantly. Opt for smart casual attire when exploring cities and
            more formal wear for dining out or attending events. Swimwear is
            appropriate only at the beach or pool; cover up when leaving these
            areas. Public behavior should be quiet and respectful; maintain a
            low volume in restaurants, shops, and public transportation, as loud
            or disruptive behavior is frowned upon. Respect queuing systems in
            places like bakeries, post offices, and public transport by waiting
            your turn patiently.
