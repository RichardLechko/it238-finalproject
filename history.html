      <h2>France's Ancient Period</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            France's history dates back to ancient times when the region was
            known as Gaul, inhabited by Celtic tribes. The Roman conquest in the
            first century BC brought significant changes, integrating Gaul into
            the Roman Empire. Roman rule introduced infrastructure, cities, and
            a new way of life, leaving a lasting legacy evident in ruins such as
            the amphitheater in Nîmes and the aqueduct Pont du Gard. This period
            of Roman influence laid the groundwork for the development of
            France's cultural identity, shaping its language, customs, and
            societal structure for centuries to come.

      <h2>France's Medieval Period</h2>
      <section>
        <span>
          <p>
            The fall of the Roman Empire led to the rise of the Frankish
            Kingdom. In 768 AD Charles the Great became king. He expanded the
            kingdom and was crowned Emperor of the Romans in 800 AD,
            establishing the Carolingian Empire and promoting a cultural revival
            known as the Carolingian Renaissance. The medieval period saw the
            development of feudalism and the establishment of powerful
            monarchies. The Capetian dynasty, starting with Hugh Capet in 987
            AD, laid the foundation for modern France. The iconic Gothic
            cathedrals like Notre-Dame de Paris and Chartres Cathedral were
            constructed during this time.

      <h2>Renaissance and Revolution</h2>
      <section class="history">
        <span>
          <p>
            The French Renaissance in the 15th and 16th centuries was marked by
            cultural and intellectual growth. Influenced by Italy, France
            experienced advancements in art, science, and literature. Kings like
            Francis I patronized artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, who spent
            his final years in France. The 17th century was dominated by the
            reign of Louis XIV, the Sun King, who epitomized absolute monarchy.
            His lavish court at Versailles became a symbol of royal power and
            artistic achievement. However, the Enlightenment in the 18th
            century, with philosophers like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu,
            began to challenge the old order, advocating for reason, liberty,
            and equality. These ideas set the stage for the French Revolution in
            1789, a watershed moment in world history. The revolution led to the
            fall of the monarchy, the rise of the Republic, and significant
            social and political upheaval. The storming of the Bastille, the
            Reign of Terror, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who later
            declared himself Emperor, are key events from this period.

            France in the 19th and 20th centuries saw a tumultuous period of monarchy, republics, and empires. The Third
            Republic, established in 1870, brought stability and industrialization. France played pivotal roles in both
            World Wars, enduring significant battles like Verdun and the Nazi occupation in WWII. The post-war era
            ushered in rapid modernization and the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958 under Charles de Gaulle.
            France's involvement in the European Union solidified its global importance.
